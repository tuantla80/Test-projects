## Mechanisms of Action (MoA) Prediction
It is a Kaggle competition (https://www.kaggle.com/c/lish-moa)  
Below is EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) and one of approaches I have attempted in this competition.  
#### 1. [Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)](https://github.com/tuantla80/Mechanisms-of-Action-Prediction/blob/master/MoA_Prediction_EDA_(Exploratory_Data_Analysis).ipynb) 
#### 2. [MoA prediction: Split Neural Network (SplitNN) method](https://github.com/tuantla80/Mechanisms-of-Action-Prediction/blob/master/MoA_prediction_using_Split_Neural_Network_(SplitNN)_method.ipynb)
